# Getting Setup

## About ClojureScript

ClojureScript is a robust, practical, and fast programming language with a set
of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool.

ClojureScript is a compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It emits 
JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the 
Google Closure optimizing compiler.

## Getting Started

To begin using this code base you will need to install Clojure on your
development system. I am using macOS as my development operating system and
used the Homebrew to install `clojure`

```
brew install clojure
```
